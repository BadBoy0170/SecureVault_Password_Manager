# SecureVault Password Manager

## Overview

SecureVault is a modern, secure password management system built with React and advanced encryption standards. It provides a robust, client-side solution for storing and managing sensitive credentials with zero-knowledge architecture.

## Key Features

- üîí **Advanced Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with client-side key derivation
- üîë **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Master password never leaves your device
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Storage**: Encrypted data storage with robust security measures
- üåê **Cross-Platform**: Access your vault from any modern web browser
- üîê **Password Generator**: Create strong, unique passwords with customizable parameters

## Security Features

- Client-side encryption using AES-256
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Secure random number generation
- No plain-text data storage

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SecureVault-Password-Manager.git
   cd SecureVault-Password-Manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Running the Production Build

Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code
  - `App.tsx`: Main application component
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks
  - `utils/`: Utility functions (including cryptographic utilities)
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions

## Cryptographic Approach

- Uses Web Crypto API for all cryptographic operations
- Implements client-side key derivation
- Encrypts individual credentials with unique keys
- Provides secure password generation

## Contributing

## Security Considerations

- Master password is never stored
- All encryption/decryption occurs client-side
- Secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
- No sensitive data transmission to servers

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add credential editing functionality
- [ ] Implement secure credential export/import
- [ ] Add multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Create browser extensions

## Disclaimer

While SecureVault implements strong security measures, no system is 100% secure. Always use additional security practices like:
- Using a unique, strong master password
- Keeping your device secure
- Regularly updating the application
